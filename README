Note: to run this project on Windows or Linux/Mac with the embedded DB H2 (easiest way):
0. If running on topcat, edit src/main/resources/application.properties and
  set the port to one of your assigned ports, preferably xxxx2 to follow
  our conventions (for example, 51302). See CS636Ports.html for your ports.

1. Load the pizza database if needed (this uses same db as in pizza1)
   cd to the database directory here.
   and use the db tools there, same as in pizza1
   
2. Use "mvn package" when cd'd to this directory to build the jar

3. On Linux or Mac, use "chmod +x *.sh" to make all shell scripts in this directory
 executable, and similarly for the database directory. 

4. Run the program to start tomcat with the webapp: using convenience script
    runJarByProfile h2 web  (Windows)   
or  runJarByProfile.sh h2 web (Linux or Mac)
or using mvn directly (see contents of runMvnByProfile). Either way, let it hang.

5. Browse to localhost:9002/welcome.html to see pizza shop site. Replace 9002 here
with your own port ending in 2 if running on topcat.

6. Run all the JUnit tests with mvn test. They are also run during mvn package.

7. The old line-oriented programs can be run outside of tomcat:
    runJarByProfile h2 SystemTest  (Windows)   (or TakeOrder or ShopAdmin)
or  runJarByProfile.sh h2 SystemTest  (Linux or Mac)

To use a real DB: you need to define environment variables 
 For Oracle database, set up env variables ORACLE_USER, ORACLE_PW, ORACLE_SITE
  For MySQL use, set up env vars MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PW, MYSQL_SITE

Then these are accessed from the profiles to set up the JDBC config.
So you can run simply  runJarByProfile oracle web   for example, and
let it hang.
